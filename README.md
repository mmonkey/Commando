# Commando
Commando takes tags created in lines of text and turns them into click-able action links.

**Examples**
Create a link in a text that reads 'daytime'. When you hover over the text it displays `/time set day` and when you click the link, it performs the command.
```
(daytime)[c:time set day]
```
